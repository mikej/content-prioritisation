# content-collection-scripts

Over the years I've amassed collections of unread ebooks collections on various sites including:

 * My Kindle library
 * [The Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com)
 * [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com)
 * [O'Reilly Member's Library](https://members.oreilly.com/)
 
 This repo contains some scripts to streamline the process of compiling a list of what's in each collection so that I can
 then put these lists into a Google Sheet and manually sort them into:
 
 * Reference books
 * To read - add these to my reading list so they can be prioritised
 * No longer relevant - stuff that's out of date or no longer of interest
